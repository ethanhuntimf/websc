Runnuning Scripts on Windows
--------
The first line of all your Python programs should be a shebang line,              
for Windows its: #! python3                                         
To run your Python program, create a .bat batch
file for running the Python program with py.exe. To make a batch file, make
a new text file containing a single line like the following:

```batch
@py.exe C:\path\to\your\pythonScript.py %*
```
